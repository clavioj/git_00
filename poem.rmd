## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

All in the golden afternoon  
Full leisurely we glide;  
For both our oars, with little skill,  
By little arms are plied,  
While little hands make vain pretense  


## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

When a friend calls to me from the road  
And slows his horse to a meaning walk,  
I don't stand still and look around  
On all the hills I haven't hoed,  
And shout from where I am, What is it?  


## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

The sun was shining on the sea,  
  Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
  The billows smooth and bright  


## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
